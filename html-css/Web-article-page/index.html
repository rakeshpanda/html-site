          <p>
            Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
            led by web development include e-commeric. Online auction sites such
            as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and
            services. Onlne retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com amoung many
            others have transformed the shopping and bargain hunting experience
            for many consumers..

          <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a
            growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
            businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and
            services to customers.[1]
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There are many open source tools for web development such as
            BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and
            Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a
            minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry
            has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software,
            such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
            Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming
            languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can
            be learned and implemented quickly.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers
            build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
            now help to deliver applications as web services which were
            traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based
            computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize
            information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the
            rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and
            Google Drive. These web services allow users to interact with
            applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a
            specific workstation for their application environment.
